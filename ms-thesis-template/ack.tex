First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor Kathryn Huff for her patient guidance
and introduction to software development, as well as her support troubleshooting along the
way. For their help starting out with \Cyclus, multiple debugging efforts, and much more thank you
to Gwendolyn Chee and Teddy Bae. Also my classmates Roberto Fairhurst, Anshuman Chuabe, Sun Myung Park, and Mark Kamuda whose support was a great help. Finally, thank you to my parents and brothers
for their never-ending support and feedback. This material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy National
