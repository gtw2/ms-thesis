Various approaches based on thermodynamic calculations and experimental studies have been used to understand the electrode reaction and efﬁciently treat spent fuels.

A large surface area as well as high corrosion resistivity was achieved through the use of inert graphite tubes. The Cl2 (g) capture was enhanced by the employment of a porous SiC shroud. It also allows an efﬁcient contact of the electrode surface to the LiCl–KCl eutectic melt for an anodic evolution. No signiﬁcant effects of the use of a SiC shroud on the anode overpotential and cell potential were found during the U deposition test.},

	abstract = {A concept of pyroprocessing light water reactor (LWR) spent fuels based on an electrochemical reduction technology is proposed, and the material balance of the processing of mixed oxide (MOX) or high-burnup uranium oxide (UO2) spent fuel is evaluated. Furthermore, a burnup analysis for metal fuel fast breeder reactors (FBRs) is conducted on low-decontamination materials recovered by pyroprocessing. In the case of processing MOX spent fuel (40 GWd/t), UO2 is separately collected for 60 wt\% of the spent fuel in advance of the electrochemical reduction step, and the product recovered through the rare earth (RE) removal step, which has the composition uranium:plutonium:minor actinides:fission products (FPs) = 76.4:18.4:1.7:3.5, can be applied as an ingredient of FBR metal fuel without a further decontamination process. On the other hand, the electroreduced alloy of high-burnup UO2 spent fuel (48 GWd/t) requires further decontamination of residual FPs by an additional process such as electrorefining even if RE FPs are removed from the alloy because the recovered plutonium (Pu) is accompanied by almost the same amount of FPs in addition to RE. However, the amount of treated materials in the electrorefining step is reduced to 10 wt\% of the total spent fuel owing to the prior UO2 recovery step. These results reveal that the application of electrochemical reduction technology to LWR spent oxide fuel is a promising concept for providing FBR metal fuel by a rationalized process.},

In this new electrochemical reduction process, electrolysis of Li2O and reduction of uranium oxide are taking place simultaneously at the cathode part of electrolysis cell. Li produced via Li2O electrolysis reacts with uranium oxide resulting in the formation of Li2O of which oxygen ion originates from uranium oxide. The resultant Li2O is electrolysed and regenerated Li is used for further reduction of the uranium oxide. The cathode part consisted of uranium oxide, stainless steel conductor, and a nonconductive porous magnesia filter. The conversion of uranium oxide to uranium metal reached more than 99\% and closed recycle of Li2O was elucidated by the observation of its concentration variation in molten-salt.},

	abstract = {Pyrochemical recycling of used nuclear has recently been an area of focus for the Material Protection, Accounting, and Control Technologies (MPACT) Campaign as this technology becomes more advanced. Therefore, chemical process models that simulate the operations within an electrochemical used fuel treatment facility are being developed to support the design and implementation of electrochemical process monitoring and material accountability systems. These codes predict the evolving material distribution of uranium and transuranics (TRU), as well as significant fission products and process components, in an electrochemical facility and in the electrorefiner in particular. Calculation of the in-process inventory serves as part of an integrated approach to safeguards by informing the design and selection of measurement techniques, sensor arrangement and measurement frequency, and the development of specialized analysis tools. The ability to predict material inventory may also be necessary when direct measurement is not practical during process operations, or when a fully integrated set of processes is not available.},

Discrete event system modeling was used to create an integrated operation model for which simulation showed that dynamic material flow could be accomplished to provide considerable insight into the process operation. In the model simulation, the amount of material transported upstream and downstream in the process satisfies a mass balance equation while considering the hold-up incurred by every batch operation. This study also simulated, in detail, an oxide reduction group process embracing electrolytic reduction, cathode processing, and salt purification. Based on the default operation scenario, it showed that complex material flows could be precisely simulated in terms of the mass balance. Specifically, the amount of high-heat elements remaining in the molten salt bath is analyzed to evaluate the operation scenario.},

The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation.

This paper presents two approaches to determine the Pu mass of spent fuel assemblies using nondestructive assay and burnup simulation code. Cm balance is adopted and the concept of “Cm ratio,” the mass ratio of Pu to Cm, is used for the nuclear material accountancy for the model pyroprocessing facility. The biggest error of the nuclear material accountancy is expected to arise from the determination of Pu mass and Cm ratio in input homogeneously mixed uranium oxide powder, which is assayed nondestructively. One approach to determine the Pu mass and Cm ratio is to apply the average burnup of spent fuel and determine the Pu mass and Cm ratio by using the ORIGEN code. The estimated error in Pu mass determined by this method ranges from 0.94\% to 2.33\% for a total of 225 spent fuel assemblies of various burnup, initial enrichment, and cooling time. The other approach is to use the functional relationship between the neutron emission rate and Pu mass of spent fuel. The error in Pu mass calculated using this method ranges from -1.68\% to 3.86\%.},

	abstract = {Key components of a novel methodology and implementation of an agent-based, dynamic nuclear fuel cycle simulator, Cyclus , are presented. The nuclear fuel cycle is a complex, physics-dependent supply chain. To date, existing dynamic simulators have not treated constrained fuel supply, time-dependent, isotopic-quality based demand, or fuel fungibility particularly well. Utilizing an agent-based methodology that incorporates sophisticated graph theory and operations research techniques can overcome these deficiencies. This work describes a simulation kernel and agents that interact with it, highlighting the Dynamic Resource Exchange ({DRE}), the supply-demand framework at the heart of the kernel. The key agent-{DRE} interaction mechanisms are described, which enable complex entity interaction through the use of physics and socio-economic models. The translation of an exchange instance to a variant of the Multicommodity Transportation Problem, which can be solved feasibly or optimally, follows. An extensive investigation of solution performance and fidelity is then presented. Finally, recommendations for future users of Cyclus and the {DRE} are provided.},

Conducting Acquisition Path Analysis (APA) is one aspect of ensuring efficient use of safeguards resources and an objective evaluation of member States. APA is designed to identify, characterize, and rank technically-feasible pathways through a fuel cycle to produce weapons-usable material. The focus of previous APA tools has been identifying diversion pathways. However, the ability to analyze pathways for material throughput capacity is crucial in estimating pathway completion times and implementing tailored safeguards. Fuel cycle simulators can be used to generate and study acquisition pathways with more detail by tracking material flows. The Cyclus fuel cycle simulator inherently represents the flows of material among facilities as a graph that can be traversed to identify the numerous acquisition pathways. This work adds material balance areas to Cyclus facilities such that a richer set of acquisition path steps can be studied. Cyclus facility archetypes implement material buffers for holding material objects internally, but flows between these buffers are internal to the archetype. A mechanism is introduced to expose the flows between these internal buffers in a way that extends the full system flow graph. A simplified case will be used to generate all possible diversion pathways and their material throughput capacity. A similar fuel cycle with a single clandestine facility will also be simulated to demonstrate how the presence of a clandestine facility expands the acquisition paths available to a diverting State.},

This text introduces the student to the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission chain reactions in a manner that renders the transition to practical nuclear reactor design methods most natural. The authors stress throughout the very close interplay between the nuclear analysis of a reactor core and those nonnuclear aspects of core analysis, such as thermal-hydraulics or materials studies, which play a major role in determining a reactor design.},

	abstract = {ORIGEN is a versatile point depletion code which solves the equations of radioactive growth and decay for large numbers of isotopes with arbitrary coupling.  The code uses the matrix exponential method to solve a large system of coupled, linear, first-order ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients.  The general nature of the matrix exponential method permits the treatment of complex decay and transmutation schemes.  An extensive library of nuclear data has been compiled, including half-lives and decay schemes, neutron absorbtion, cross sections, fission yields, disintegration energies, and multigroup photon release data.  ORIGEN has been used to compute the compositions and radiactivity of fission products, cladding materials, and fuel materials in LWRs, LMFBRs, MSBRs, and HTGRs.  The applications are illustrated with calculated inventories and radiation levels for spent fuel irradiated to a burnup of 33,000 MWd/metric ton in a PWR spectrum.},
