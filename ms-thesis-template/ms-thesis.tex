\documentclass[edeposit,fullpage,12pt]{uiucthesis2009}
% Use draftthesis for notes and date markings on every page.  Useful when you
%   have multiple copies floating around.
% Use offcenter for the extra .5 inch on the left side. Needed with fullpage and fancy.
% Use mixcasechap for compatibility with hyperref package, which does NOT like all caps default
% Use edeposit for the adviser/committee on the title page.
% Use tocnosub to suppress subsection and lower entries in the TOC.
% PhD candidates use "proquest" for the proquest abstract.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor Kathryn Huff for her patient guidance
and introduction to software development, as well as her support troubleshooting along the
way. For their help starting out with \Cyclus, multiple debugging efforts, and much more thank you
to Gwendolyn Chee and Teddy Bae. Also my classmates Mikayla Molnar, Roberto Fairhurst, Anshuman Chuabe, Sun Myung Park, and Mark Kamuda whose support was a great help. Finally, thank you to my parents and brothers
for their never-ending support and feedback. This material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy National
Nuclear Security Administration under Award Number(s) DE-NA0002576 through
the Consortium for Nonproliferation Enabling Capabilities.
